        <p>My favorite hobby is playing badminton. I love to play badminton because its fun, it gives strength, it increases height and it increases concentration level.I play badminton with my Friends. I even go to badminton classes.Badminton is a sport for two or four( "singles" or "doubles") people. The game is either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players.The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets. I enjoy playing Badminton Thankyou.
